- [PHP_CodeSniffer Standards Composer Installer Plugin](https://github.com/DealerDirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer):
The package depends on codesniffer and automatically configures its installed_paths config setting. We no longer have to overwrite that setting in order to get our ruleset to work.
This enables additional rulesets to be defined on the project level without needing to think about when to set the installed_paths key.
