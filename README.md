This repository has been archived and renamed, moved to [iO PHP_CodeSniffer Standard](https://github.com/iodigital-com/php-code-sniffer-standard). Feature sniffs and changes will be processed in the iO repository.


ISAAC PHP_CodeSniffer Standard
===========

Extending the default [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) with ISAAC rules

**Note**: Adding new phpcs-rules to this package must result in a major version update!

### Installation

Require the package:

```
composer require --dev isaac/php-code-sniffer-standard
```

### Setup
Create a `phpcs.xml`-file in the root of your project, and include the default ISAAC ruleset:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ruleset name="phpcs-isaac">
    <!-- include root folder of project -->
    <file>.</file>
    <!-- exclude paths -->
    <exclude-pattern>./src/Migrations</exclude-pattern>
    <exclude-pattern>./vendor</exclude-pattern>

    <!-- include all rules in isaac ruleset -->
    <rule ref="ISAAC"/>
</ruleset>
```

Change the name of the ruleset, modify the excluded paths and/or include custom rulesets for your project.

#### PHPCompatibility

To get the most out of the PHPCompatibility standard, you should specify a testVersion to check against.
That will enable the checks for both deprecated/removed PHP features as well as the detection of code using new PHP features.
Include the testVersion by adding a config rule in your `phpcs.xml`. Examples:

```
    <config name="testVersion" value="7.0"/> <!-- check for compatability with php 7.0 -->
    <config name="testVersion" value="7.1-"/> <!-- check for 7.1 and higher -->
    <config name="testVersion" value="7.0-7.2"/> <!-- check within range 7.0 to 7.2 -->
```

### Usage

Since you now have a `phpcs.xml` file in the root of your project, you can run the default phpcs-command: `vendor/bin/phpcs`.

#### Ignoring sniff violations

Sometimes a violation of a sniff cannot be resolved. In this case, the violation should be ignored using the `phpcs:ignore` and `phpcs:disable` / `phpcs:enable` annotations.

In order to do this, please take the following approach:
1. Ignore only the *parts* of the file that cause the violation, not the file itself. If it is *really* the case the file should be ignored, you can use the `phpcs:ignoreFile` annotation or, better, add an `<exclude-pattern>` to the `ruleset.xml` of the project.
2. Prefer `phpcs:ignore` over `phpcs:disable` and `phpcs:enable`, i.e. use `phpcs:ignore` when this is possible and when the placement of the `phpcs:ignore` does not introduce any other sniff violations, use `phpcs:disable` and `phpcs:enable` otherwise. Rationale: using `phpcs:disable` and `phpcs:enable` might disable more code than initially intended when adding new code or moving existing code, for instance when refactoring code.
3. Always indicate the exact sniff or sniffs that are going to be ignored, use the complete sniff name, not only the sniff group. So for instance use `phpcs:ignore Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing.BeforeFirst, Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing.AfterLast` instead of `phpcs:ignore Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing` or `phpcs:ignore` without any arguments.
4. Prefer placing the `phpcs:ignore` annotation on a separate line *before* the violation over placing it on the line of the violation itself. Rationale: when ignoring multiple sniffs, the `phpcs:ignore` annotation can quickly exceed the line length limit; this is *not* checked when the `phpcs:ignore` annotation is placed on a separate line before the violation, but it is checked when the `phpcs:ignore` annotation is placed on the line of the violation itself.
5. Add an explanation why the sniff is ignored using `--` followed by a short explanation.

Example:

```php
try {
    $this->logger->log(LogLevel::INFO, new DateTimeImmutable());
//phpcs:ignore Generic.CodeAnalysis.EmptyStatement.DetectedCatch -- DateTimeImmutable creation cannot fail in this case
} catch (Exception $exception) {
}
```

### Contributing

If you want to to contribute, create a merge request with **one sniff per merge request**. Please provide
an example in the description of what the sniff is about with a good and bad code snippet.
